In the middle of this century we turned to each other
With half faces and full eyes
like an ancient Indian picture
And for a short while.

I stroked your hair
In the opposite disha to your journey,
We called to every other,
Like calling out the


My heart is a fancy place
Where giant reddish-purple cauliflowers
& white ones in French & English are outside
Waiting to welcome you to a boat
Over the low black river for a big dinner
There's alot of choice among the foods
Even a tortured lamb
